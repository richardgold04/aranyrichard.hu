              I have been working on digital projects for almost 10 years.
              During this time, I also created websites and webshops in
              Wordpress. I worked online, working from traditional SMEs to
              startups. Iâ€™ve also been involved in founding an influencer agency
              and planning the online presence of a music startup.
